<h1>Step 1 - Git init</h1>
<p>The first thing we need to do is use the terminal(often called a command prompt in Windows) to navigate to the directory that our project is in. In this example, you can see the terminal's working directory is: C:\Users\meow\Desktop\githubTest<br />

<br />Once we have found the directory that our project is in, the first step will be using a command called git init. This will initialize the directory as a working Git repository.<br />

<br />Take note, upon a successful git init, there will be output in the terminal that says: Initalized empty Git repository in followed by the path to your project. Once this step has been completed, you will be able to proceed to the next step.<br />

<br />Commands used so far:<br />
git init<br /></p>
