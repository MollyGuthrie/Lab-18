<h1>Step 3 - Git Add</h1>
<p>Now that we have checked our status and need to add files to tracking, let's run through two ways to do this.<br />

<br />The first way is by typing: git add FILENAME. This will add a single file. You can add multiple files in this way by separating each file with a single space.<br />
The second way is by typing: git add . This will add ALL files within that directory to tracking.
Once we ran that command, we get a message saying that warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in... all of the files you have added. Don't worry too much about that for now, it isn't broken.<br />

<br />Lets go ahead and check out the repository's status by running our trusty git status. Notice something different now? That's right, the files are no longer in a red font color. All of your added files are in a green font color now. When files are green, it means that it is staged.<br />

<br />Commands used so far:<br />
<br />git init git status git add<br /></p>
