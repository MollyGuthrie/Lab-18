<h1>Step 6 - Add remote Origins</h1>
<p>Once you create that repository, you will be greeted with this screen. we know it looks scary, but we will get through this together.<br />

<br />A little more than halfway down, there will be an option that says: "...or push an existing repository from the command line" which will have two lines of code under it.<br />

<br />Just like the picture shows, you can either BOTH of those lines of code, or you can simply click on the COPY icon located on the right-hand side of that option's container.<br />

<br />Commands used so far:<br />
<br />git init git status git add git commit<br /></p>
