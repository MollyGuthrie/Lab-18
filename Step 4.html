<h1>Step 4 - Git Commit</h1>
<p>Once again, the first thing we will do is check our repository's status. I know we have checked the status quite a bit so far, but it is always better to know what is going on than be left guessing<br />

<br />Notice upon checking the status, we get a message that says: On branch master followed by: Initial Commit and then: Changes to be commited:...Git is always giving us hints for what we need to do next. Since we don't want to remove the files we have added to the staging area, let's skip to actually making our first commit!<br />

<br />In order to commit our changes, we need to run the command: git commit -m "Some message". It is important to remember we need to add the -m flag and then a message in quotations. In this example, we ran git commit -m "first commit", which creates a commit titled 'first commit'. If successful, you should get some response that files were changed and some modes were created.<br />

<br />Lets go ahead and check out the repository's status by running our trusty git status. Notice something different now? That's right, the files are no longer in a red font color. All of your added files are in a green font color now. When files are green, it means that it is staged.<br />

<br />Note: if you run git status right now, it will say: On branch master, nothing to commit, working directory clean.<br />

<br />Commands used so far:<br />
<br />git init git status git add git commit<br /></p>
