<h1>Step 5 - Create Repository</h1>
<p>TIn your browser, navigate to GitHub and sign in.<br />

<br />On the main page, you will see two large buttons: Read the Guide and Start a Project - go ahead and click Start a Project. This will take you to a page that has a few fields to type into and some other options further down.<br />

<br />For demonstration purposes, we only typed into the Repository Name field. We didn't give a description, didn't check the private, or play with any of the other options below that.<br />

<br />DO NOT CHECK Initialize this repository with a README. If you have already done this, delete the repository in the settings tab and recreate it.<br />

<br />Once you have typed in a repository name, go ahead and click Create Repository<br />

<br />Commands used so far:
<br />git init git status git add git commit</p>
