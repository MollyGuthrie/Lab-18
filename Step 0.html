<h1>Step 0 - Basic Commands</h1>
<p>There are a few basic commands we will need to have under our belt in order for us to start using Git. These commands are using in your terminal. <br/>

<br />cd ~: takes you to the root of your user's home directory. <br/>

<br />cd folder name: changes the directory the terminal is working from to the folder name given. <br/>

<br />cd ..: moves the terminal "back" one folder. <br/>

<br />ls: lists files and folders within the current directory. <br/>

<br />ls -a: lists all files and folders(including hidden) within the current directory. <br/>

<br />clear: clears the terminal screen. <br/>

<br />rm file: deletes a file. <br/>

<br />rm -r folder: deletes the folder. <br/>

<br />rm -rf folder: deletes the folder without any confirmation. <br/>

<br />touch file: creates a file. <br/>

<br />mkdir folder: creates a folder with the folder name given. <br/>

<br />mv file/folder new name for file/folder: renames the file/folder with the new name(this can use used to move files/folders).</p>
